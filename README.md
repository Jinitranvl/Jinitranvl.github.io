# Nini Tran Portfolio

A responsive, single-page portfolio for civil/structural engineer Nini Tran. The site highlights background, featured projects, downloadable resume, and contact details through an animated, Vue-powered layout.

## Live Site
- https://jinitranvl.github.io/

## Highlights
- **Hero + navigation:** Smooth-scrolling navigation bar keeps visitors oriented while the hero introduces Nini with quick facts and calls to action.
- **About & experience timeline:** Rich biography, value statements, and a chronological breakdown of professional experience and education with badges for technical skills and languages.
- **Projects gallery:** Filterable project grid with hover overlays, tag chips, and modal popups containing technology stacks, descriptions, and external links.
- **Resume download:** Direct download of the latest resume from `resume/Niniresume.pdf` plus an at-a-glance professional summary.
- **Contact section:** Validated form (name, email, message) that opens the user’s mail client, alongside email, phone, location, and LinkedIn details.
- **Mobile-friendly styling:** Components use scoped styles and CSS utility classes to stay legible across phones, tablets, and desktops.

## Repository Layout
```
assets/   # Bundled JavaScript and CSS generated by Vite
images/   # Static imagery referenced in components
resume/   # Downloadable PDF resume
index.html
```

## Running Locally
The repo already contains the production build. Any static HTTP server (or opening `index.html` in a browser) will load the site, but using a server avoids CORS issues:

```bash
# Option 1: use the built-in Python server
python3 -m http.server 4173
# Option 2: use `serve` (installs globally if you don't have it)
npx serve .
```
Then visit the printed URL (e.g., http://localhost:4173).

## Customizing
- Update imagery or icons inside `images/` and re-run your static server.
- Replace `resume/Niniresume.pdf` with an updated PDF to change the download link.
- For deeper edits (copy, data, styling), modify the original Vue source project, run `npm run build`, and deploy the new `dist` output to this repository.
